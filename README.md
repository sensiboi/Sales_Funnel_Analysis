# Sales_Funnel_Analysis

In todayâ€™s competitive retail environment, businesses operate across both physical and digital platforms, creating an omnichannel ecosystem where customers move seamlessly between online and offline touchpoints. While this integration enhances customer convenience, it also increases the complexity of tracking and improving sales conversions. A well-structured sales funnel is vital for converting potential customers into actual buyers, yet many retailers struggle with identifying where customers drop off and why. This study focuses on evaluating sales funnel performance in omnichannel retail using a combination of descriptive and inferential statistical methods. The research adopts a dual approach, utilizing both primary and secondary data. Primary data is collected through structured consumer surveys to capture behavioral insights regarding purchase frequency, channel preference, cart abandonment, and factors influencing buying decisions. Secondary data, comprising retail sales figures and funnel metrics, is analyzed statistically to evaluate conversion rates at each stage of the funnel. Techniques such as frequency distribution, hypothesis testing, and ANOVA are applied to identify significant differences in funnel performance across channels, time periods, and customer segments.
